This is consistent with the presence of sinus bradycardia, which is a type of ST depression. The presence of atrial fibrillation is also evident from the irregular R-R intervals in the precordial leads, which is consistent with the presence of atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB) is also evident from the abnormal QRS complexes in leads V1-V6, which are characterized by a prolonged R-R interval and a widened QRS complex. This is consistent with the presence of a left bundle branch block, which is a type of conduction abnormality.\n\nThe presence of 1dAVb(", "answer_id": "RP2fbDWFk2jUpRjXJCQYX5", "model_id": "/home/dang.nh4/PULSE/ml-fastvlm/output/fastvlm1.5B-orig/checkpoint-2314", "max_new_tokens": 256, "metadata": {}}
{"question_id": "code15-1523783", "prompt": "Determine the appropriate class for the ECG image: 1dAVb(1st degree av block), RBBB(right bundle branch block), LBBB(left bundle branch block), SB(sinus bradycardia), ST(sinus tachycardia), AF(atrial fibrillation). The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $CLASS(;CLASS)' (without quotes and separate multiple classes with a semicolon if any), where CLASS is one of the above candidate classes.", "text": "Answer: $CLASS(1dAVb(1st degree av block))\nWe can determine the appropriate class for the ECG image by analyzing the specific patterns and features observed in the tracing. The presence of a first-degree AV block is indicated by the abnormal P-wave morphology, which is consistent with the presence of a conduction delay between the atria and ventricles. The ST segment depression is also a characteristic feature of sinus tachycardia, which is a type of tachycardia that occurs in the presence of a sinus node that is not generating a normal rhythm. The absence of any signs of atrial fibrillation, such as a rapid and irregular rhythm, further supports the conclusion that the ECG is consistent with sinus tachycardia. Therefore, the appropriate class for this ECG image is sinus tachycardia.\nNote: The answer is based on the analysis of the ECG image and the interpretation of the specific patterns and features observed. The classification of the ECG image is subjective and may vary depending on the clinician's expertise and experience.\nWe can also consider the possibility of other cardiac conditions, such as left ventricular hypertrophy or cardiomyopathy, which may be contributing to", "answer_id": "Vdapm4USU2dnXwdgYfv5Hj", "model_id": "/home/dang.nh4/PULSE/ml-fastvlm/output/fastvlm1.5B-orig/checkpoint-2314", "max_new_tokens": 256, "metadata": {}}
